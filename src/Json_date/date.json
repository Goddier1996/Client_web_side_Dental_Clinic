If you have swollen, bleeding gums (known as gingivitis) or other gum disease, your dentist may want to see you more often. Some adults with gum disease may see a dentist three or four times a year. More frequent exams may help prevent a serious gum disease known as periodontitis. Periodontitis can lead to infection and tooth loss."
